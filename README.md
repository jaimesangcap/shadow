# shadow

Some useful CLJS things. Stuff I collected over the past few years and use in a couple projects. Didn't want to create a library for each one so they ended up here.


## Current version

```clojure
[thheller/shadow-client "1.1.0"]
```

## Useful and Current

- [shadow.markup](https://github.com/thheller/shadow/wiki/shadow.markup)
- shadow.dom (working directly on the DOM)
- shadow.api (running code from HTML)
- shadow.xhr

### Experimental (React related, extremely ALPHA)
- shadow.react.*

### Probably going away

- shadow.animate

### Deprecated and old: Do Not Use.

- shadow.object
- shadow.ui.*
- shadow.legacy.*
